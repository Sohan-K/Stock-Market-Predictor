# Stock Predictor

A machine learning-based stock price predictor using Jupyter Notebook. This project applies data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data.

## Features
- Uses historical stock price data from a CSV file
- Implements machine learning models to predict stock trends
- Data visualization for insights
- Supports model evaluation and performance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd stock-predictor
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`data.csv`).
2. Run the preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
3. Train the machine learning model.
4. Evaluate model performance.
5. Visualize predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset (`data.csv`) contains historical stock prices with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
